Setup failed:
'npm install' command failed because the 'package.json' file is missing from the repository root '/usr/src/prompttosoftware-frontend'.
The directory contains 'package-lock.json' but not 'package.json'.
'package.json' is required by npm to identify project dependencies and execute 'npm install'.

This issue prevents further setup as dependencies cannot be installed without this file, which contradicts the instruction "You should be able to get them to run without editing any files."
A 'package.json' file needs to be provided in the repository for setup to proceed.
