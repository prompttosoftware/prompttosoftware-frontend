To set up the project environment:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests (example: this specific test):
   ```bash
   npm test src/app/\(main\)/new-project/page.test.tsx
   ```
   (Note: The tests ran, but produced errors. This is acceptable as per the task instructions.)

The project is now set up for development and testing.
