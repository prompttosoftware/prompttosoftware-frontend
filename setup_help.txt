Project Setup Instructions:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run `npm install` in the project root directory.

2.  **Verify test runner (Jest) functionality:**
    To confirm Jest is set up and can run tests (they do not need to pass), execute the following command:
    `npm test "src/app/(main)/new-project/page.test.tsx"`
    This command specifically targets a single test file to quickly verify the test environment.
    (Note: Parentheses in the path required double quotes for proper shell interpretation.)
