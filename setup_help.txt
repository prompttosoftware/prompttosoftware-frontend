**Project Setup Instructions:**

To set up the project environment:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Verify Test setup (optional):**
    ```bash
    npm test src/app/EmptyState.test.tsx
    ```
    (This test should pass, indicating Jest and the environment are correctly configured.)

3. **Verify running a page test:**
   ```bash
   npm test src/app/(main)/new-project/page.test.tsx
   ```
   (This test is expected to execute without "file not found" errors, confirming the correct path. It may still report failing tests, which is acceptable for setup verification.)

The project is now set up for development and testing.
