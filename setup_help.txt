Project Setup Instructions:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the project root directory.

2.  **Install missing testing library dependency:**
    Run `npm install @testing-library/dom`

3.  **Verify test runner (Jest) functionality:**
    To confirm Jest is set up and can run tests (they do not need to pass), execute the following command:
    `npm test src/components/TestComponent.test.tsx`
    This command specifically targets a single test file to quickly verify the test environment.
    (Note: Parentheses and square brackets in the path may require double quotes for proper shell interpretation.)
