1. Ran `npm install` to install project dependencies.
2. Verified test runner (Jest) functionality by running a specific test file using quoting: `npm test "src/app/(main)/components/BalanceDisplay.test.tsx"`.
The tests generated output, indicating the test runner is functional. They do not need to pass for this setup phase.
