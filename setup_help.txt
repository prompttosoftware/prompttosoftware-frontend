To set up the project:
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. The tests can then be run using `npm test`. For example, `npm test src/app/EmptyState.test.tsx` was used to verify the setup.
3. The tests DO NOT need to pass for setup to be complete.
4. The instructions in this file were created by running `npm install`, then running `npm test src/app/EmptyState.test.tsx` to verify the tests were runnable. Then `setup_help.txt` was written to with the instructions.action: NEXT_SUBTASK
