Setup Instructions for prompttosoftware-frontend:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root directory and run the following command to install all necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Verify Test Runner:**
    After installing dependencies, confirm that the test runner (Jest) is working by executing a specific test file. For example:
    ```bash
    npx jest src/app/api/mock-error/route.test.ts
    ```
    This command should execute the specified test file and show its results (pass/fail). The goal is to confirm that the test environment is functional, not necessarily that all tests pass.

This completes the basic project setup to enable development and test execution.
You are now ready to proceed with development tasks.
The next task is to implement the Generic Loading and Empty State Components.
